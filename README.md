# Exercism

## Journey

Here you will find my entire journey with Exercism. <br>
Below are all the exercises I have completed. <br>
Some of these exercises from the Easy level are downright trivial, so perfect for knowledge-hungry new programmers, but it doesn't hurt to take a few moments to confirm knowledge (i.e. mark the exercise in green to make it look pretty on the dashboard :smirk: ) and hopefully help new Exercism users on their own journey.

1. The exercises are tabulated according to the levels set by the creators and contributors of Exercism . 
2. The order of the exercises follows the order on the dashboard.
3. Only completed exercises are added. More will be added when I manage to complete any of the remaining exercises.
